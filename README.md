# text_Classification
Jupyter notebook with experiments for text classification using LSTM.

A dataset with text from three different categories is explored. We have tried three models, Naive Bayes, SVM, and LSTM. Step by step explanation and commentary on the methods is given in the notebook.

Notebook also has an interactive application in the end where all three models can be tested on random data inserted by the user.
